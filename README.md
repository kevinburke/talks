# Talks

This repo contains a list of topics I'd be happy to talk to your company or
conference about. [Click here to book me for your next conference][mailto].

I must admit I haven't given many talks at conferences. I have given many
talks in the past though, in college courses as well as internally at Twilio,
and I am very comfortable on stage. To give you a sense for my ability
to present information, [here is a video of me talking about foreign aid][aid].
Here is a video of me [teaching HTML to community managers in San
Francisco][html].

## About Me

I am an API Engineer at Twilio, a company that makes it easy for web developers
to integrate phone calls and SMS into web applications. I am responsible for
maintaining Twilio's documentation and [API libraries][twilio-github]. One time
I came within seven places of making the National Spelling Bee.
