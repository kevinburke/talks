How to Write Documentation for People That Don't Read

Usability researchers have known for years that people browsing the Internet
don't read things word by word - they scan pages for the content they want. Yet
many API's and documentation resources are written as though users are reading
every word. If busy users can't find what they are looking for, you'll have
more support tickets (an expense), or more frustration (lost revenue).

Writing effective documentation requires knowing who your users are and how
they are finding answers to their questions. In this talk we'll take a look at
several different ways your product documentation is failing busy users. We
will look at examples from user testing performed with Twilio customers, and
share the lessons we've learned. We will investigate how users find (or fail to
find) your documentation, and the importance of good performance in areas you
might not traditionally consider to be documentation, like error messages and
SEO.
