How to Write Documentation for People That Don't Read

Usability researchers have known for years that people don't read things word
by word - they scan pages for the content they want. Yet most documentation is
written as as if users read every word. If busy users can't find what they're
looking for, you'll have more support tickets (an expense) and even more
frustration (lost revenue). In this talk, we'll look at several different ways
your documentation is failing users and the lessons we've learned from testing
with Twilio customers. We'll also investigate how users find (or fail to find)
your documentation and the importance of optimizing things you might not
traditionally consider to be documentation.
