# Baumol's Cost Disease

## Economics

How do people/organizations allocate resources?

How do people/organizations respond to incentives?

## *Not* taking a position on:

- Socialism
- Capitalism
- Unions
- Job guarantee
- What's better, government or private industry
- AI

## Assuming:

- People want to get a raise every year/as they get more skill

## What is productivity?

- How many people it takes to do stuff
- How much time it takes to do stuff
- How much it costs to be able to do stuff
- How much space an object takes up

## Example: calculators for NASA

## Example: farming

http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=11&psid=3837

1800: farmers are 83 percent of the workforce
2010: farmers are 1.5% of the workforce

## Is that bad?

## How does that happen?

- Farmer Alice retires. New Grad Bob trains as an accountant

- Industry doesn't need as many new people as it grows

- Layoffs

- Retraining (not very effective)

- Adjacent industries (transportation...)

## Examples of productivity increasing

- Traveling from New York to SF

- Harvesting 1000 stalks of wheat

- Doing 1000 calculations

- Sending a message to someone in New York

- Building a website

## What about areas where productivity doesn't increase?

## William Baumol

## Why do artists starve?

## Part 1: Nonprofits can always make a higher quality product

## Part 2: Costs are going to increase forever

## Wages rise as productivity increases*

## How much does a company have to pay?

## Salary (very roughly): How much do we have to pay to get you to *not* work at
## all of the other companies?

## Say a company gets more productive

10 people can make 2 cars per day = $1000 revenue/worker/day

10 people can make 4 cars per day = $2000 revenue/worker/day

## They are willing to pay more for workers!

## What happens at the companies that are not productive, if another company is
## willing to pay more?

## Google, etc.

## Baumol: What happens at the *nonprofits* that are not productive, if another
## company is willing to pay more?

## Productivity in the performing arts is not increasing

## Mozart's String Quartet No. 22

## Mozart's String Quartet No. 22

- How many people to play it in 1800?
- How many people to play it in 2000?
- How long does it take?

## Examples of productivity... meh

- Getting a haircut

- Diagnosing an illness

- Hour long massage

- Teaching first grade to 30 students

- Serving drinks at a bar

## How much do you have to pay a (barber/dancer/masseuse) to *not* make
## cars/work for Google etc?

## Barbers in a land of productivity increases

Wage increases mean haircuts cost more

Cost of a haircut is going to rise faster than the cost of everything else
(food, rent)

Over the long run this means haircuts will be bigger and bigger % of the economy

## "Cost disease"

## Human-driven industries this affects

- Education

- Healthcare

- Performing arts

## Baumol Prediction about share of the economy

baumol1993.pdf - both charts of manufacturing, ag, education

## Why are jobs so bad?

In the past sixteen years, 94 per cent of the net jobs created were in
education, healthcare, social assistance, bars, restaurants, and retail, even
though those sectors only employed 36 per cent of America’s workforce at the
start of the millennium…

## Are healthcare and education just gonna be expensive forever?

## We do have small productivity improvements

Travel from Vienna to Frankfurt for a concert: 6 days in 1790
Today: 4 hours

## Possible to listen to music everywhere

## Healthcare:

- Safer cars means fewer accidents + fewer hospital bills

- Improvements in procedures

- Decrease in error rate

## *If* people are getting richer

We can spend more money on healthcare+education without cutting back on anything
else

Bad news for *individual people* if wages are not increasing

## What does this imply?

In the US and Europe typically the government provides or pays for *most*
healthcare and education.

Rising shares of healthcare + education costs == government has larger and
larger share of the economy

## Tax revenues

Tax increases are highly contentious

CA: Have to vote on every tax increase. Property taxes capped at 1% of
property value, 2% increase per year, by law. Costs growing faster than this

## "The nature of the right choice is by no means clear"
