# Baumol's Cost Disease

## Economics

How do people/organizations allocate resources?

How do people/organizations respond to incentives?

## *Not* taking a position on:

- Socialism
- Capitalism
- Unions
- Job guarantee
- What's better, government or private industry
- AI

## Assuming:

- People want to get a raise every year/as they get more skill

## What is productivity?

- How many people it takes to do stuff
- How much time it takes to do stuff
- How much it costs to be able to do stuff
- How much space an object takes up

## Example: calculators for NASA

## Example: farming

http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=11&psid=3837

1800: farmers are 83 percent of the workforce
2010: farmers are 1.5% of the workforce

## Is that bad?

## How does that happen?

- Farmer Alice retires. New Grad Bob trains as an accountant

- Industry doesn't need as many new people as it grows

- Layoffs

- Retraining

- Adjacent industries (transportation...)

## Examples of productivity increasing

- Traveling from New York to SF

- Harvesting 1000 stalks of wheat

- Doing 1000 calculations

- Sending a message to someone in New York

- Building a website

## William Baumol

## What about areas where productivity doesn't increase?

## Mozart's String Quartet No. 22

## Mozart's String Quartet No. 22

- How many people to play it in 1800?
- How many people to play it in 2000?
- How long does it take?

## Examples of productivity... meh

- Getting a haircut

- Diagnosing an illness

- Teaching first grade to 30 students

- Reporting the news

- Serving drinks at a bar

## What does this mean?

- Population needs 100 potatoes per person per year
- 10 haircuts per person per year

One farmer for every 1000 potatoes == 10 potato farmers for every 100 people
One barber for every 1000 haircuts == 1 barber for every 100 people

## Share of the labor force

Farming - 10%
Barbers - 1%

## After productivity increase:

One farmer for every 500000 potatoes == 1 potato farmer for every 5000 people
One barber for every 1000 haircuts == 1 barber for every 100 people

## Share of the labor force

Barbers - 1%
Farming - 0.02%

## People want raises. Which is good!

## Giving farmers a raise - not really a problem.

## Giving barbers a raise..

Cost of a haircut is going to rise faster than the cost of everything else
(food, rent)

Over the long run this means it will be bigger and bigger % of the economy

## "Cost disease"

## Human-driven industries this affects

- Education

- Healthcare

- Performing arts

## Baumol Prediction about share of the economy

## Why are jobs so bad?

In the past sixteen years, 94 per cent of the net jobs created were in
education, healthcare, social assistance, bars, restaurants, and retail, even
though those sectors only employed 36 per cent of America’s workforce at the
start of the millennium…

## Are we doomed?

## We do have small productivity improvements

Travel from Vienna to Frankfurt for a concert: 6 days in 1790
Today: 4 hours

## Possible to listen to music everywhere

## Healthcare:

- Safer cars means fewer accidents + fewer hospital bills

- Improvements in procedures

- Decrease in error rate

## Generally speaking we are getting richer

We can spend more money on healthcare+education without cutting back on anything
else

## Is housing a cost disease good?

Rent is expensive. Not really... zoning more of a factor. Costs not increasing
as much in Texas, which builds housing

## What does this imply?

In the US and Europe typically the government provides or pays for *most*
healthcare and education.

Rising shares of healthcare + education costs == government has larger and
larger share of the economy

## Tax revenues

Tax increases are highly contentious

CA: Have to vote on every tax increase. Property taxes capped at 1% of
property value, 2% increase per year, by law. Costs growing faster than this

## "The nature of the right choice is by no means clear"
