I've also given this talk internally at Twilio. While the talk is geared a
little more toward our internal audience, you can find the slides for that
version here: http://kev.inburke.com/slides/api-library-design/. I am going to
adjust the content for an outside audience (and rewrite it in PHP).

You should pick this because API's are becoming more and more popular!
Especially as companies follow Amazon's lead and move to a service oriented
architecture, which means they are using HTTP internally to retrieve data from
other resources within the company. Developers will want clients to consume
those internal or external API's, and there are several principles we've
learned that can save people a lot of pain when writing wrapper libraries.
