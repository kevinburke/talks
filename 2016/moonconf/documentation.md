Most documentation is written as as if users read every word, which can turn
users off, since they often aren't _reading_. We'll look at usability research,
lessons we've learned from user testing in the wild, and learn how users are
failing to find your docs!

If your users can't make heads or tails of your documentation, they won't ever
get started with your project, or they'll ask questions over and over that
you'll get tired of answering. We'll examine usability research about how users
read (hint: they don't), look at several different ways your documentation
is failing busy users, and the lessons we've learned from user testing with
Twilio customers. We'll also investigate how users find (or fail to find) your
documentation, and the importance of clear writing in other areas, like your
error messages.

## Description

It's 3AM, do you know where your users are? If people want to learn how to use your product, where are they looking for help? Are they on your site, and if they're on your site, are they finding the right page?

Usability researchers have known for decades that users don't read word by word - they *scan* for the content they want.

If users can't make heads or tails of your documentation, they'll give up (a loss of revenue), remain ignorant of product features (another loss of revenue) or ask needless support questions (an increased cost).

In this talk we'll examine the *findability* of your documentation, and the text on the pages in your documentation. We'll examine usability research into how users read, look at several ways your documentation is failing busy users, and the lessons I learned conducting user tests at Twilio. We'll learn more about how users find the answers they are looking for, and the importance of spreading clear writing across not just your documentation, but your headlines and error messages in your API.

## Notes

I previously gave this talk at Write the Docs 2015, where it was acknowledged (in personal remarks, Tweets, etc) as one of the top talks of the conference - the audience really loved the content and took a lot home.

We'll look at research that recommends why you should write shorter on the Internet and use bold and headers a lot in your documentation - anything that breaks up the flow of paragraphs on the page. We'll look at our own research - our customers were getting stuck trying to use our product with error messages guiding them to pages that were entirely off our domain - StackOverflow, GetSatisfaction, even Wikihow. We had to figure out how to make more compelling pages for their use cases, or reach out to people on the platforms that they were visiting. We'll look at how you might be scoring own goals with your documentation - for example gating your docs behind a PDF will fail to reach the ~50% of your/our customers that are trying to find answers via a Google search.

We'll also look at techniques that technical writers can use to make things better. A targeted error message can go a long way - telling the user _why_ they hit an error, and what they can do to fix it, or where they can look for more help. Anyone can help contribute to these - strings are the easiest things to grep for in a large codebase and can be found/fixed easily.
