## The story you'd like to tell

It's really hard to design great UI's for virtual reality. How do you enter in
letters if you can't assume a keyboard? How would you process a credit card if
you have to take off the device to read the card number? For virtual reality,
not only do you have to tackle new UI problems with every interface, but a
thoughtless UI can make your users physically sick.

In this talk we'll survey the wild west of virtual reality UI's, and look at
some examples of good and bad UI designs in VR. You'll learn about the best
practices for capturing user input that have emerged on platforms like the new
Gear VR.

You'll learn about the causes of simulator sickness, and the UI antipatterns
that cause people to become sick. We'll talk about the types of experiences
that make for great virtual reality experiences, as well as experiences that
could be terrifying or sickness inducing.

We'll take a very short look at MozVR, Firefox's alpha virtual reality API's,
and how you can build great UI's using WebVR and three.js.

Let's get started!

Kevin explains what works and what doesn't in virtual reality design at [Twenty
Milliseconds](https://twentymilliseconds.com). When he's not trying to break
down VR UI's, he's watching sports, reading great stories or learning how to
get better at what he does.
