### intro

- My name is Kevin Burke, I work on the API team at Twilio.

- We offer an API that lets developers make calls and send text messages

- This means if people can't figure out how to use the API they can't pay us

- So we spend a fair amount of time thinking about our documentation

### Once upon a time, people wrote documentation that no one read

- Obviously there are people that don't write documentation

- You can also decrease the need for documentation by designing a better
  interface, etc. 

- These problems are outside the scope of this talk. Write documentation

### So you've got some documentation

- I bet you still get support questions about stuff that's answered in the docs

- If you do user testing or any kind of lifecycle analysis, you will probably
  see dropoff between users signing up and users that figure out how to use the
  API. Lots of reasons go into this - product not useful in your area, customer
  not in the target market, etc. - but possible that they couldn't figure out
  how to get started.

### As a user this is frustrating as hell

- This is why gary bernhardt gets mad on the internet

- This is why people give up computers

### Why do users get frustrated?
