How to Write Documentation for People That Don't Read

Most documentation is written as as if users read every word. Yet usability
researchers have known for years that people don't read things word by word
- they scan pages for the content they want.

If your users can't make heads or tails of your documentation, they won't ever
get started with your project, or they'll ask questions over and over that
you'll get tired of answering. We'll examine usability research about how users
read (hint: they don't), look at several different ways your documentation
is failing busy users, and the lessons we've learned from user testing with
Twilio customers. We'll also investigate how users find (or fail to find) your
documentation, and the importance of clear writing in other areas, like your
error messages.
