- fix github pages
- find documentation percentage
- quickstart "next page" links

keith feedback:

- think about this in user stories
- as a documentation writer, think about your users as "trying to do X"
- we can think of writing documentation like writing code
- correctness
- maybe as a conclusion

Testing:

- User tests
- What is the success rate
- Walk people through a user test

3 goals:

"When somebody leaves my presentation, I hope they remember these 3 things."

- how to write for the web
- "writing documentation" shouldn't be the end goal. solving user problems
  should be
- what kinds of problems do users have when they're trying to accomplish tasks
  with your tool (a substitute for user testing)
- what you're likely to find when you start user testing
- you can quantify this stuff the same way you quantify programming

Once upon a time people wrote documentation that users didn't read
Every day users would get frustrated trying to get started with projects and
not being able to figure out how. This is why people give up using computers
and gary bernhardt gets mad on the internet
One day authors started thinking about users goals instead of just documenting
everything.
Because of that, they started researching how users ran into problems.
Because of that, they found people were coming to their documentation from Google.
Because of that, they realized instead of pointing users to the documentation
from error messages, they could make the error messages the documentation.
Until finally user success rates got much higher
